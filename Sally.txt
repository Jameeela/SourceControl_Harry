Hi BARRY, 

I was wondering if you were driving to NYC. I need a ride. Just moving there fore a new job....a new gender....having an adventure! WHO KNOWS! Let me hit you with my rhythm stick, 

Harry

P.s. Don't worry, I won't make a pass at you! I love Amanda! 


Hi Harry, 

I actually was going to be driving to Wyoming.  I want to make a life for myself as a lion-tamer. But I'm worried you'll make a pass at me.  Will you?

Sally
