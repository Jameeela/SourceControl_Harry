On your mark ready set let's go
Dance floor pro I know you know
I go psycho when my new joint hit
Just can't sit
Gotta get jiggy wit it
Ooh that's it
Now honey honey come ride
DKNY all up in my eye
You gotta Prada bag with alotta stuff in it
Give it to your friend let's spin
Everybody lookin' at me
Glancin' the kid
Wishin' they was dancin' a jig
Here with this handsome kid
Ciga-cigar right from Cuba-Cuba
I just bite it
It's for the look I don't light it
Illway the an-may on the ance-day oor-flay
Givin' up jiggy make it feel like foreplay
Yo my car-dee-o is Infinit-
Ha ha
Big Willie Style's all in it
Gettin' Jiggy Wit It
